Classification is a supervised machine learning task widely applied in various domains to predict categorical outcomes based on input features (Sisodia, 2018). The consumption of drugs has significant social and health implications, making it a critical area of study. Machine learning offers powerful tools to analyze such datasets, uncovering patterns and predicting behaviors based on demographic and psychological features (Breiman, 2001). This report examines the Drug Consumption (Quantified) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, leveraging machine learning techniques to classify consumption behaviors. The analysis aims to understand drug usage patterns, provide actionable insights, and explore how these findings can aid in addressing drug-related societal challenges.
Dataset Description 
The Database contained records for 1885 respondents. For each respondent 12 attributes were known: Personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity were in the dataset.
